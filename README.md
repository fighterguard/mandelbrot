# mandelbrot
This is a very simple web app that allows visualization of the Mandelbrot set

Simply download all of the files into any folder in your computer, then open the index.html file with Chrome (I don't recommend Firefox for this, it's at least 3 times slower than Chrome at rendering each frame), and enjoy!

Be careful, though. If you go overboard with the number of iterations, you may cause your browser to freeze for several minutes.
